### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently building a 100%-Swift sync system for my app, Medo e Delírio - [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/medo-e-del%C3%ADrio/id1625199878).

- 🌱 I’m currently studying SwiftUI, Vapor and Core Data (🥲).

- 🤔 I’m looking to grow as an iOS Developer, so please feel free to leave comments and/or open issues with code suggestions!

- 💬 Ask me about Swift, SwiftUI, SQLite.swift, Vapor and great UXs.

- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="https://toot.wales/@mitt_rafael" target="_blank">`Mastodon`</a>

- 😄 Pronouns: he/they

- ⚡ Fun fact: My knees still have the scars from when I felt too confident with a bike as a child.
