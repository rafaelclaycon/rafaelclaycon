### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying, writing and developing apps. You can read about my explorations [in my blog](https://from-rafael-with-code.ghost.io/) and follow [Medo e DelÃ­rio](https://github.com/rafaelclaycon/MedoDelirioBrasilia) pull requests to see the latest developments of [my app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/medo-e-del%C3%ADrio/id1625199878).

- ðŸŒ± My main growth focus right now is SwiftUI and growing my understanding of software design patterns.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to grow as an iOS Developer, so please feel free to leave comments and/or open issues with code suggestions.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Swift, SwiftUI, TDD, unit tests, Vapor, UX design, and SQLite.
