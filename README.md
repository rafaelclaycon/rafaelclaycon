### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on The Library Is Open, a pet project to archive the episodes of one of my favorite podcasts ever (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/ummilkshakechamadowanda" target="_blank">`UMCW`</a>).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about audio playback and Combine on iOS.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Combine and good coding practices in general. Feel free to DM me with any questions or tips.

- 💬 Ask me about Swift and SwiftUI.

- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="http://twitter.com/mitt_rafael" target="_blank">`@mitt_rafael`</a>
