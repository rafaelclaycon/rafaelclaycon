### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on new features for my app, [Medo e Delírio](https://github.com/rafaelclaycon/MedoDelirioBrasilia), a fun companion to the **Medo e Delírio em Brasília** podcast - [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/medo-e-del%C3%ADrio/id1625199878).

- 🌱 My main growth focus right now is SwiftUI and it's many challenges.

- 🤔 I’m looking to grow as an iOS Developer, so please feel free to leave comments and/or open issues with code suggestions!

- 💬 Ask me about Swift, SwiftUI, TDD, unit tests, Vapor, UX design, and SQLite.

- ✍️ I write about what interests me here: [From Rafael with Code](https://from-rafael-with-code.ghost.io/)
