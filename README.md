### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently enjoying working on Medo e DelÃ­rio, my first app [published to the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/medo-e-del%C3%ADrio/id1625199878)!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying all kinds of stuff, from server-driven UI to server-side Swift.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with good coding practices in general. Feel free to DM me with any questions or tips.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Swift, SwiftUI, SQLite.swift and great UXs.
