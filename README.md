### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on new features for my app, Medo e DelÃ­rio - [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/medo-e-del%C3%ADrio/id1625199878).

- ðŸŒ± My main growth focus right now is SwiftUI and it's many architecture intricacies.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to grow as an iOS Developer, so please feel free to leave comments and/or open issues with code suggestions!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Swift, SwiftUI, SQLite.swift, Vapor, great UXs, and TDD.

- âš¡ Fun fact: As a kid I would pile VHS tape cases to build tiny buildings for my playtime. I got my first Lego set when I was 11. Remember VHS?
